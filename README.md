# Twitter_Clone

Building a small clone of Twitter. It will feature logged in users, a customized homepage, a tweet composing page, the ability to follow other users, and more.


There will be four pieces to this application, each with their own app:

*   config <--  project folder
*   twitteruser <-- This is a custom user app!
*   tweet <-- corresponding to the tweets
*   authentication <-- relating to auth/login/signup
*   notification <-- handling notifications for follows/mentions


EachÂ app will (potentially) need its own:

*   models.py
*   views.py
*   urls.py
*   forms.py
*   \_\_init\_\_.py
